# Node-Dev-Course
This repository contains my progress through an in-depth [Node developer's course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/ "Click for more details") on Udemy. The courses guides you through 4 different projects; a notes app, weather app, task app, and a chat app. Each project is designed to explore all the features that Node has to offer.

I chose this course to better my understanding of backend development, because it was the area I was weakest in at the end of bootcamp experience at Launch Academy. Now that I have improved my backend understanding, I will return to my capstone project Winemate and improve its backend capabilities.
